Miscellaneous notes
===================

---------
I tried to run the reduction script with ASN files that contain *all* of the available observations for GOODS-N.  I got as far as iolprep, which broke because one of the iraf tasks it uses (wtran) doesn't output its results with enough decimal precision given the input image size.  I edited /usr/stsci/stsdas/python/axe/axesrc/awtran.py as follows:

#xin = float(split(line)[1])
#yin = float(split(line)[2])
#xout = float(split(line)[4])
#yout = float(split(line)[5])
# (gbb) above breaks for 
# Xin,Yin:    504.67820-13194.11936 Xout,Yout:   5208.18000   851.60700
# (a very large input image)
if line.find('***') > 0:
    xin = -9000
    yin = -9000
    xout = -9000
    yout = -9000
else:
    xin = float(line[9:22])
    yin = float(line[22:34])
    xout = float(line[48:58])
    yout = float(line[58:-1])

Add SVN keyword properties:

svn propset svn:keywords "Rev URL Author Date" combine_phot.py

AXEPREP warns you if only a few percent of the grism image is available for
computing the background level. This becomes a problem when you have a low S/N
threshold value for the object catalog and therefore have grism spectra that
nearly cover the image.  The prompt interrupts the flow of the automated pipeline.

Edit the following lines as so in /usr/stsci/stsdas/pkg/analysis/slitless/axe/axesrc, line 457

# idec = IrafParS(['         Continue or quit? [(y)es/(q)uit] :(q)','string','h'],'whatever')
# idec.getWithPrompt()
# dec = idec.value.strip()
dec = 'Y'
